    <h1>Are Latter-day Saints Christian?</h1>
    <P>Yes. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a Christian church but is neither Catholic nor
        Protestant. Rather, it is a restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ as originally established by the Savior in
        the New Testament of the Bible. The Church does not embrace the creeds that developed in the third and fourth
        centuries that are now central to many other Christian churches.

        Latter-day Saints believe God sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to save all humanity from death and their individual
        sins. Jesus Christ is central to the lives of Church members. They seek to follow His example by being baptized
        (see Matthew 3:13–17), praying in His holy name (see Matthew 6:9–13), partaking of the sacrament (see Luke
        22:19–20), doing good to others (see Acts 10:38) and bearing witness of Him through both word and deed (see
        James 2:26). The only way to salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ.</P>

    <h1>What do Latter-day Saints believe about God?</h1>
    <p>God is often referred to in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as our Heavenly Father because He is
        the Father of all human spirits and they are created in His image (see Genesis 1:27). It is an appropriate term
        for God, who is kind and just, all-wise and all-powerful. God the Father; His Son, Jesus Christ; and the Holy
        Ghost constitute the Godhead, or Trinity, for Church members. Latter-day Saints believe God is embodied, though
        His body is perfect and glorified.</p>

    <h1>Do Latter-day Saints believe in the Trinity?</h1>
    <P>Latter-day Saints most commonly use the term “Godhead” to refer to the Trinity. The first article of faith for
        the Latter-day Saints reads, “We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the
        Holy Ghost.” Latter-day Saints believe God the Father, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost are separate personages,
        but one in will and purpose—not literally the same being or substance, as conceptions of the Holy Trinity
        commonly imply.</P>
    <h1>What is the Latter-day Saint view of the purpose of life?</h1>
    <p>For Latter-day Saints, mortal existence is seen in the context of a great sweep of history, from a pre-earth life
        where the spirits of all humankind lived with Heavenly Father to a future life in His presence where continued
        growth, learning and improving will take place. Life on earth is regarded as a temporary state in which men and
        women are tried and tested—and where they gain experiences obtainable nowhere else. God knew humans would make
        mistakes, so He provided a Savior, Jesus Christ, who would take upon Himself the sins of the world. To members
        of the Church, physical death on earth is not an end but the beginning of the next step in God’s plan for His
        children.</p>
    <h1>Do Latter-day Saints believe in the Bible?</h1>
    <p>Yes. The Church reveres the Bible as the word of God, a sacred volume of scripture. Latter-day Saints cherish its
        teachings and engage in a lifelong study of its divine wisdom. Moreover, during worship services the Bible is
        pondered and discussed. Members are encouraged to include the Bible in their family and personal daily scripture
        study. Additional books of scripture—including the Book of Mormon—strengthen and reinforce God’s teachings
        through additional witnesses, and they provide moving accounts of the personal experiences many individuals had
        with Jesus Christ. According to Church apostle M. Russell Ballard, “The Book of Mormon does not dilute nor
        diminish nor de-emphasize the Bible. On the contrary, it expands, extends, and exalts it” (“The Miracle of the
        Holy Bible,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2007, 82).</p>
    <h1>What is the Book of Mormon?</h1>
    <p>In addition to the Old and New Testaments of the Bible, the Book of Mormon, named after one of its ancient
        prophets, is another testament of Jesus Christ. It contains the writings of prophets, giving an account of God’s
        dealings with the peoples who lived anciently on the American continent. For Latter-day Saints it stands
        alongside the Old and New Testaments of the Bible as holy scripture.</p>
    <h1>What is a temple?</h1>
    <p>Temples existed throughout biblical times. These buildings were considered the house of the Lord (see 2
        Chronicles 2:1–5). Latter-day Saint temples are likewise considered houses of the Lord by Church members.

        To Latter-day Saints, temples are sacred buildings in which they are taught about the central role of Christ in
        God’s plan of salvation and their personal relationship with God.

        In temples, members of the Church make covenants, or promises, with God to live a virtuous and faithful life.
        They also participate in ordinances on behalf of their deceased ancestors.

        Temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are also used to perform marriage ceremonies in which
        the faithful are promised eternal life with their families. For members of the Church, family is of central
        importance.</p>
    <h1>Do Latter-day Saints believe in modern-day prophets?</h1>
    <p>Yes. The Church is governed today by apostles, reflecting the way Jesus organized His Church in biblical times.
        Three apostles constitute the First Presidency (consisting of the president, or prophet of the Church, and his
        two counselors), and together with the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, they have responsibility to lead the
        Church worldwide and serve as special witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ. Each is accepted by Church members in
        a prophetic role corresponding to the apostles in the Bible.</p>
    <h1>Do Latter-day Saints believe that the apostles receive revelations from God?</h1>
    <p>Yes. When Latter-day Saints speak to God, they call it prayer. When God responds through the influence of the
        Holy Spirit, members refer to this as revelation. Revelation, in its broad meaning, is divine guidance or
        inspiration; it is the communication of truth and knowledge from God to His children on earth, suited to their
        language and understanding. It simply means to uncover something not yet known. The Bible illustrates different
        types of revelation, ranging from dramatic visions to gentle feelings—from the “burning bush” to the “still,
        small voice.” Latter-day Saints believe that divine guidance generally comes quietly, taking the form of
        impressions, thoughts and feelings carried by the Spirit of God.</p>
