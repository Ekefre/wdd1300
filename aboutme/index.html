            Hi everyone, my name is Saviour Udo though my friends call me M10 and I
            am cool with the name I am studying for a BSC on applied technology, right from my high school days it has
            always been my dream to study
            computer programming actually, BYU Idaho online program is a dream come true
            for me. I am from Nigeria and currently living in a small city (Ibeno) located in
            the southern part of the country and closer to the Atlantic ocean in the
            south.

            I have been a member of the church from birth I actually grew up to love
            the church, all the teachings and mostly our redeemer Jesus
            Christ, and through His pure love towards the children of men I actually
            had a strong desire to serve a fulltime mission which I successfully
            served in the Nigerian Port Harcourt Mission here in my country from a
            year 2018 to 2020.
        </p>

            and beyond.
